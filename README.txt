CS 4280 Program Translation

Use the 'make' command to compile the project. 

The project can be invoked using
     ./main (and you will have to type in the words followed by "EOF)
     ./main < file.sp2022 (where file is the name of the file and .sp2022 is a required extension)
     ./main file.sp2022
